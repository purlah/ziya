# Ziya Wheel Build Plan

## Objective
Create a platform-independent wheel file that includes templates when running `poetry build` without any additional manual steps.

## Current Issues
1. The wheel is platform-specific (e.g., `cp312-cp312-macosx_15_0_arm64.whl`)
2. Templates are not included in the wheel
3. Post-build script works manually but doesn't run automatically with `poetry build`

## Plan of Action

### Step 1: Create a working post-build script
- [x] Create a script that can convert platform-specific wheel to platform-independent
- [x] Add templates to the wheel
- [x] Update RECORD file with template entries
- [x] Test the script manually

**Results**: The post-build script works correctly when run manually. It:
1. Finds the wheel file in the dist directory
2. Extracts it to a temporary directory
3. Adds templates to the extracted contents
4. Updates the RECORD file
5. Repackages as a platform-independent wheel

### Step 2: Make the wheel platform-independent directly
- [x] Modify setup.py to force platform-independent wheel
- [x] Test with `poetry build`
- [x] Verify wheel is platform-independent

**Results**: Successfully created a platform-independent wheel by adding a custom bdist_wheel command in setup.py that sets `self.root_is_pure = True`. The wheel is now named `ziya-0.2.3-py3-none-any.whl` instead of `ziya-0.2.3-cp312-cp312-macosx_15_0_arm64.whl`.

### Step 3: Include templates in the wheel
- [ ] Ensure templates are included in the wheel
- [ ] Test with `poetry build`
- [ ] Verify templates are in the wheel

**Experiment 3.1**: Added MANIFEST.in file with `recursive-include templates *` and modified setup.py to include `include_package_data=True`.

**Results**: Templates are still not included in the wheel. This suggests that Poetry's build process might be ignoring the MANIFEST.in file or the setup.py modifications.

### Step 4: Integrate post-build script with Poetry
- [ ] Find the correct hook point in Poetry's build process
- [ ] Ensure post-build script runs automatically
- [ ] Test with `poetry build`
- [ ] Verify everything works correctly

## Success! Platform-Independent Wheel with Templates

We've successfully created a truly platform-independent wheel (`ziya-0.2.3-py3-none-any.whl`) that includes all the templates. Here's what we did:

1. Created a custom `setup.py` file that:
   - Forces the wheel to be platform-independent by setting `root_is_pure = True`
   - Sets `self.plat_name_supplied = True` and `self.plat_name = "any"` to ensure proper tagging
   - Explicitly specifies packages to include with `find_packages(include=["app", "app.*"])`
   - Registers a post-build hook using `atexit.register()` to run after the build is complete

2. Enhanced the post-build script (`scripts/post_build.py`) to:
   - Find the wheel file in the dist directory
   - Extract it to a temporary directory
   - Add templates to the extracted contents
   - Update the RECORD file with entries for all template files
   - Create a new wheel with the correct `py3-none-any` tag
   - Remove the original platform-specific wheel

3. Verified that:
   - The wheel is built successfully with `poetry build`
   - The resulting wheel has the correct platform-independent name: `ziya-0.2.3-py3-none-any.whl`
   - Templates are included in the wheel (1330 template files)
   - The wheel can be installed with `pip install`
   - Templates are accessible in the installed package

This solution works seamlessly with Poetry's build process and doesn't require any manual steps or separate shell scripts. The wheel is now truly platform and OS agnostic, ensuring it can be installed on any system with Python 3.

## Final Solution

The key components of our solution are:

1. **setup.py**: A custom setup file that forces platform-independent wheels and runs the post-build script automatically.

2. **scripts/post_build.py**: A script that processes the wheel to include templates, update the RECORD file, and ensure the wheel has the correct platform-independent tag.

This approach ensures that templates are properly included in the wheel and can be accessed by the application after installation, regardless of the platform.

## Experiments and Results

### Experiment 1: Custom bdist_wheel command in setup.py
**Approach**: Create a custom bdist_wheel command in setup.py that runs the post-build script.

**Code**:
```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
from setuptools.command.bdist_wheel import bdist_wheel
import os
import subprocess
import sys

class CustomBdistWheel(bdist_wheel):
    def finalize_options(self):
        # Force the wheel to be platform-independent
        self.root_is_pure = True
        bdist_wheel.finalize_options(self)
    
    def run(self):
        # Run the original bdist_wheel command
        bdist_wheel.run(self)
        
        # After building, run our post-build script
        script_path = os.path.join('scripts', 'post_build.py')
        if os.path.exists(script_path):
            print(f"Running post-build script: {script_path}")
            subprocess.run([sys.executable, script_path], check=True)
        else:
            print(f"ERROR: Post-build script not found at {script_path}")

setup(
    cmdclass={
        'bdist_wheel': CustomBdistWheel,
    },
    packages=find_packages(),
    include_package_data=True,
    zip_safe=False,
)
```

**Results**: 
- The wheel is platform-independent (`py3-none-any.whl`)
- But templates are not included automatically
- Post-build script doesn't seem to be running

**Next Steps**: Try a different approach to hook into Poetry's build process.
