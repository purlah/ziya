# Alarm Actions Refactor Test Case

This test case verifies the correct application of a diff that refactors the `addAlarmActions` method in the CloudWatchMonitoringCDKStack class to make it more configurable by accepting optional parameters for different alarm actions.

## Changes

1. Replaces specific imports from `monitoringConstants` with a more generic import from `@amzn/sim-ticket-cdk-constructs`
2. Modifies the `addAlarmActions` method signature to accept optional parameters for different environment alarm actions
3. Updates the method implementation to use the provided alarm actions or fall back to the default ones

## Expected Behavior

The diff should be applied correctly, resulting in a more flexible implementation that allows custom alarm actions to be specified per environment while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.

## Related User Feedback

This test case was created based on user feedback where the diff was successfully applied but needed to be verified for correctness.
