type 'typescript jsx' doesn't invoke prism syntax hghlighting in either codeblocks or diffs
some jsx code, espcially open ended spans and other bracket conetnt, does not render
diff apply, while significantly more robust, is still a work in progress and should be used at your own risk:
 -- there is the potential for some corruption, especially for single line additions
D3 and VegaLite renderers are incomplete, don't tell the model about them and you should be fine.
the green status checkmark is meant for streaming responses received while out of context, but it still shows up for most recent responses when you are in the context and switch away from it as well
there are some messy rej and orig diff files from some of the interim stages that are left around, even when a more advanced apply pipeline stage later successfully completed the rest of the hunks.
